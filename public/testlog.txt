The Good: Improved speed everywhere (new processor, faster wireless, quicker Touch ID sensor); a sturdier body; better front and rear cameras; a bold new 3D Touch pressure-sensitive display that could end up being a really useful tool in apps down the road, and which already offers new iOS shortcuts.<br><br>The Bad: Same battery life as the iPhone 6. The 6S Plus model remains the only way to get optical image stabilization for photos and video, plus better battery life. You&#39;ll need to pay extra to vault past the too-small storage of the entry-level 16GB version.<br><br>The Bottom Line: The newest iPhones are top-to-bottom better phones with lots of enhancements; iPhone 6 owners don&#39;t need the upgrade, but everyone else should seriously consider it.

The Good: Improved speed, better cameras, always-on Siri, and pressure-sensitive 3D Touch display compared to last year&#39;s 6 Plus. And it has slightly better battery life, a bigger higher resolution screen, and optical image stabilization for photos and video that can make a difference.<br><br>The Bad: It&#39;s really big. It costs more than the smaller iPhone. Other phablet-sized phones offer longer battery life.<br><br>The Bottom Line: The iPhone 6S Plus has a few key advantages that give it an edge for serious iPhone users, but its big body still may not fit for a lot of people.

The Good: Improved speed, better cameras, always-on Siri, and pressure-sensitive 3D Touch display compared to last year&#39;s 6 Plus. And it has slightly better battery life, a bigger higher resolution screen, and optical image stabilization for photos and video that can make a difference.<br><br>The Bad: It&#39;s really big. It costs more than the smaller iPhone. Other phablet-sized phones offer longer battery life.<br><br>The Bottom Line: The iPhone 6S Plus has a few key advantages that give it an edge for serious iPhone users, but its big body still may not fit for a lot of people.

The new Apple iPhone 6s isn&#39;t a radical change, but it makes for a great, hassle-free experience that should satisfy those in need of an upgrade.

The Good: Improved speed everywhere (new processor, faster wireless, quicker Touch ID sensor); a sturdier body; better front and rear cameras; a bold new 3D Touch pressure-sensitive display that could end up being a really useful tool in apps down the road, and which already offers new iOS shortcuts.<br><br>The Bad: Same battery life as the iPhone 6. The 6S Plus model remains the only way to get optical image stabilization for photos and video, plus better battery life. You&#39;ll need to pay extra to vault past the too-small storage of the entry-level 16GB version.<br><br>The Bottom Line: The newest iPhones are top-to-bottom better phones with lots of enhancements; iPhone 6 owners don&#39;t need the upgrade, but everyone else should seriously consider it.
