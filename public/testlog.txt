5 | Does the Job Well | Fenix | August 31, 2015
Loved the mil of these laminate sheets. Not too thick, not too thin. I have laminated many things for my classroom and they do not peel apart or wrinkle the item being laminated. The price is great, as well. Will be buying more of these once I run out. Great buy on a great great product!

2 | Jams every time | MrJohnson | December 26, 2015
I bought this today to use for my classroom. Every time that I print a full sheet, the left side hangs up and jams. I have ruined several items already. When I print smaller sizes, it does not have that problem. It is just the left edge of the full size. I will be taking this back monday morning. Not happy.

This machine is easy to use and for the [$] sale price is worth every penny. The refills cost a bit more, but if you catch them on sale you would be doing great.

This sweater fits like a charm. My fianc wore it to dinner. He likes that way it&#39;s form fitting with out being tight. But the two shades for the burgundy one just looks like u have a under shirt on with a thin sweater.

I had been buying Lacoste since my teenage days and it&#39;s fit never changes. Simple<br>but looks very elegant. Macy&#39;s is on of the few retailers who carry almost the line of<br>Lacoste and I just love it!!

5 | I would buy this again, very comfortable and versatile. | Dave1894 | January 8, 2016
Pros: Breathable; High Quality; Warm; Versatile; Comfortable; Stylish<br><br>it is a very light weight sweatshirt, yet it retains heat well on cooler days. I like to wear it out fishing the flats, because of the upf 50 sun protection. it helps me protect my neck and ears in the spring time and even on some warmer winter days catching flounder,trout, and reds. It is also great to wear to the gym or run in since it has the inner pocket for a phone.

5 | Great All-Around Hoodie | Matt | January 7, 2016
Pros: Comfortable; Stylish; Warm<br><br>I&#39;ve been a fan of NorthFace hoodies for a long time, and this is another hoodie to add to the list.  It&#39;s true to size, it&#39;s comfortable, and it looks great.  It even has a neat little pocket inside of the Kangaroo pouch of the hoodie to put things in: like an iPod shuffle, keys, etc.  I also really like the color choices!

Pros: High Quality; Washes Well; Comfortable; Breathable; Stylish; Versatile; Warm<br><br>I purchased this as a Christmas present for my husband.  He loves it!  It is comfortable, lightweight, and surprisingly warm for how lightweight it is.  My husband doesn&#39;t comment on clothes too much, but he has mentioned several times how much he likes this sweatshirt and would like another one.

Pros: Works for all skin types, absorbs quickly, light, non-greasy formula<br><br>Cons: No antioxidants or other added benefits<br><br>CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion is very similar to the thicker CeraVe Moisturizing Cream. The two formulas offer the same active ingredients and both are effective; the lotion is simply a lighter version, according to cosmetics expert Paula Beguon,.

4.5 | Cerave Moisturizing Lotion Review: Ranked on Best Body Lotion for Normal Skin | Anonymous | November 5, 2013
While most body lotions require frequent application, CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion does not because it nourishes your skin all day through slow, control release of essential ceramides and emollient ingredients. As a result, skin&#39;s barrier because stronger and moisture loss is decreased. Your skin will become able to retain moisture better, resulting in overall healthier skin. Since this non-irritating lotion is not greasy and won&#39;t clog your pores, it&#39;s safe to use on both your body and face. It also spreads smoothly and evenly for easy application.

5 | Great everyday facial lotion! | Shannon | January 7, 2016
I&#39;d been using the Cetaphil line of facial lotions for a while since I have very sensitive and dry skin but wasn&#39;t satisfied with the price and the greasy look it gave me after application (lotion, not cream which made me look even greasier!) and it felt pretty heavy on my skin. I decided to try out CeraVe because I&#39;d heard great things about it from friends. This moisturizer does a great job of keeping my face hydrated, is light-weight, absorbs quickly into the skin, and does NOT leave my face looking shiny. Really great moisturizer, couldn&#39;t be happier.

4 | they were okay | shelby | December 2, 2015
these hurt me really bad when I took them off, and my blackheads weren&#39;t that bad, but the strip still did not remove most of what I did have. I tried doing it twice but, maybe it&#39;s just my skin. overall, I would recommend this product because maybe it would work better for someone who had deeper blackheads on their nose.

4 | Definitely a must have | kelly | September 8, 2013
I&#39;ve used really cheap pore strips that work just as well, but I used one of these the other day at my friends house. I like that the nose strips have notches cut in to make it lie flat against the nose. It really made it easier to get it on and touch every part of the nose. It pulled out all of my blackheads and my nose skin feels amazing now. I&#39;m going to try out the other strip on my chin soon, so hopefully it works just as well there. The only thing I don&#39;t like about these Biore strips is that they cost too much for the amount I&#39;m getting. If they were cheaper it would be a 5/5 review.

I received the Biore Heated Mask as a free sample in exchange for writing a review about it online. I liked it. It becomes warm upon contact with wet skin. Made my face feel very smooth, and was overall a very pleasant experience. It rinses off cleanly. I`d use it again.

5 | Just what I was looking for | Sparkywriter | December 21, 2011
Pros: Durable Construction; Color Variety<br><br>I especially like that these are clear since I am using them in a mass produced organizer system. They feel substantial enough to sustain continued use in the book. The fact that they have a pocket both front and back is a bonus.<br>Inserting the tabs is a little tedious, however it&#39;s a great product overall.
