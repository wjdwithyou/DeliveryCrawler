Loved the mil of these laminate sheets. Not too thick, not too thin. I have laminated many things for my classroom and they do not peel apart or wrinkle the item being laminated. The price is great, as well. Will be buying more of these once I run out. Great buy on a great great product!

I bought this today to use for my classroom. Every time that I print a full sheet, the left side hangs up and jams. I have ruined several items already. When I print smaller sizes, it does not have that problem. It is just the left edge of the full size. I will be taking this back monday morning. Not happy.

I&#39;d been using the Cetaphil line of facial lotions for a while since I have very sensitive and dry skin but wasn&#39;t satisfied with the price and the greasy look it gave me after application (lotion, not cream which made me look even greasier!) and it felt pretty heavy on my skin. I decided to try out CeraVe because I&#39;d heard great things about it from friends. This moisturizer does a great job of keeping my face hydrated, is light-weight, absorbs quickly into the skin, and does NOT leave my face looking shiny. Really great moisturizer, couldn&#39;t be happier.

these hurt me really bad when I took them off, and my blackheads weren&#39;t that bad, but the strip still did not remove most of what I did have. I tried doing it twice but, maybe it&#39;s just my skin. overall, I would recommend this product because maybe it would work better for someone who had deeper blackheads on their nose.

4 | Definitely a must have | kelly | September 8, 2013
I&#39;ve used really cheap pore strips that work just as well, but I used one of these the other day at my friends house. I like that the nose strips have notches cut in to make it lie flat against the nose. It really made it easier to get it on and touch every part of the nose. It pulled out all of my blackheads and my nose skin feels amazing now. I&#39;m going to try out the other strip on my chin soon, so hopefully it works just as well there. The only thing I don&#39;t like about these Biore strips is that they cost too much for the amount I&#39;m getting. If they were cheaper it would be a 5/5 review.

This little charm is certainly a charmer! It&#39;s adorable! The snap opens to reveal a mini purse, no pockets though. I love having it swing from any of my bags, even those that aren&#39;t Michael Kors. The color is to love! I want a full size in the blush but most are bigger than I like. If you are a purse lover, go for it, you&#39;ll love it!

The handles CAN slide off, but this does not happen when using the tool. Even if it did, I would just use some adhesive. This is the best, most basic reliable workhorse for insulated terminals. I have used it for years and it will outlive me. It takes some muscle, so if you have more than 50~100 crimps you need something else.

5 | Cute as can be! | moonwillowmlc | January 6, 2016
This little charm is certainly a charmer! It&#39;s adorable! The snap opens to reveal a mini purse, no pockets though. I love having it swing from any of my bags, even those that aren&#39;t Michael Kors. The color is to love! I want a full size in the blush but most are bigger than I like. If you are a purse lover, go for it, you&#39;ll love it!

3 | Good quality item, but doesn't serve much purpose | MoBeckz | January 4, 2016
Received this for free with my purchase of a purse. It matches my purse in color, which is nice, but I don&#39;t see much purpose for it. If it closed more securely, it could serve as a coin pouch, but it&#39;s purely decorative.

5 | Classic Hoody | Anonymous | January 8, 2016
This is the hoody to have. Iconic North Face logo on the front, butter soft cotton fleece, and the consistent fit that you expect from The North Face. I&#39;ve been wearing their clothing and sleeping in their bags and tents for over two decades and I&#39;ve never been disappointed. This hoody is no different. I expect it to be part of my wardrobe for years.

1 | Cheaply made | Kristin | November 14, 2015
I just received this and washed and dryed it. The elastic in the bottom and sleeve cuffs are completely shot. It looks like I&#39;ve worn it every day for a year. Not happy with it.

3 | Comfy, but careful when washing | Jeff | December 15, 2014
This hoodie is really soft and pretty warm. Good for tooling around town, but dunno if I would take it on the mountain with me. <br><br>One word of caution, mine shrunk waaaaaaay down when I first washed. I am gonna see if I can exchange it or something cause now the sleeves barely reach my forearms when my arms are extended outwards and it isn&#39;t very comfortable to wear, plus makes me look like a doofus.
